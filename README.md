# NexusShield
NexusShield detects coordinated fraud by modeling accounts, devices, IPs, and transactions as a connected graph. Using Graph Neural Networks, it identifies high-risk nodes, uncovers hidden fraud rings, and surfaces actionable cluster-level alerts to stop organized attacks early and reduce financial loss.
